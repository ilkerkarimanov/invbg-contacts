When it comes to end-to-end testing, you might be reluctant at first. Is end-to-end testing a painful topic for you? I want to show you how I’ve managed to make end-to-end testing not so tedious and expensive but fun. My article in Smashing Magazine will give you an insight into how I handle end-to-end testing with Cypress without running into traps. To achieve this, we’ll write a very-own test for the Smashing Magazine website together.

This repository contains the examples we created in mentioned guide. Feel free to check them out and use them to get started with end-to-end-testing in Cypress.
